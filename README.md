# Project Ami

Building the Next Generation of the Internet

## What is it?

Project Ami is a suite of tools, specs, and languages that detail and define a new way of creating apps, pages, and documents on the Internet.

Currently there are 3 parts to Project Ami:
- __Uta__: A new programming language designed for the post-modern world
- __Jushin__: A replacement for web browsers enabling Hoso apps to be discovered and rendered on user machines securely and quickly
- __Hoso__: A framework for building building apps with Uta-lang

## Why?

Because HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all have a bunch of flaws due to them being primarily design for other tasks and then coopted for modern web app development. Project Ami takes the 30 years of ideas and experience we've had with these tools, improves upon them, and bring ideas from other languages and tools into the mix.
